                Step 1: Define base materials and processes
            </h6>
            <p>
                On the page <a class="link-primary" href="/materials/base">Base materials and processes</a> you can
                create your own materials or processes with a given type (Powder, Liquid, Aggregates, Admixture,
                Process or Custom).
                You may define Cost Properties, Composition and Additional Properties if needed.
            </p>
            <p>
                A table of all base materials in the database is shown below.
                You may edit or delete materials if needed by clicking on the corresponding icons for each entry.
            </p>
            <h6>Step 2: Blend base materials to create blended materials</h6>
            <p>
                On the page <a class="link-primary" href="/materials/blended">Blended materials</a>
                you can blend two or more base materials of the same type.
                Once you confirm your selection, you have to pick the increment and the maximum and minimum percentages
                of each material in the blend.
                The last entry is autocompleted for you. An autocorrect feature prevents the user from entering numbers
                outside the range of possibilities.
            </p>
            <p>
                After generating the one entry for each possible blend, you may add your own combinations manually or
                delete some combinations generated by the app.
                Once you are satisfied with the blends to be generated, you just have to click a button and they will
                appear in the table.

                Step 3: Create specific entries for a dataset by combining materials (base or blended) and
                processes
            </h6>
            <p>
                On the page <a class="link-primary" href="/materials/formulations">Materials Formulations</a>
                you can choose various of your previously defined materials and processes to define material
                formulations.
                Currently, it is required to specify at least one powder, one liquid and one aggregate.
                In addition, you need to specify a constraint on the total weight.
                Once configured, you can specify ranges for material weights with an autocompletion feature
                analogous to the one in Step 2 (the dependent material is always the aggregate).
            </p>
            <p>
                Next, you can edit or delete the generated weight configurations.
                Once finished, you can create the formulation as a dataframe.
                You can do similar steps to add another batch of data.
                Having created all formulation batches, the data can be saved as a dataset to be used in the
                next step.
            </p>
            <h6>
                Step 4: Apply Sequential Learning and other algorithms to a dataset
            </h6>
            <p>
                On the page <a class="link-primary" href="/materials/discovery">Material Discovery</a>
                all your datasets are listed.
                Here it is possible to also add new datasets in terms of a csv upload.
                For each dataset you can specify various target values.
            </p>
            <p>
                The dataset can now be used for prediction of a new candidate material.
                For that purpose, you need to specify various pieces of information such as
                features, targets, a-priori information etc.
                With the resulting configuration, the experiment can be started.
                As a result you are shown the data rows sorted with respect to their utility.
                The first row is predicted to be most promising.
